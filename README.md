## Hi there 👋

My name is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/samuel-martin023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Samuel Martin</a>, and I am based in the United States.

<strong>University of North Texas</strong> | Bachelor of Science | <em> Ecology for Environmental Science</em> 🌱 |  May 2025

Very analytical and technical person who craves learning new subjects and ideas, primarily in science and technology-based fields.

Recently finished and published a <a href="https://samuelm27290.github.io/Libri-Samuelis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">website</a> that displays and recommends all of the books that I currently have in my bookshelf.
